            Players must stay ahead of the beasts by answering a series of questions where each correct response allows our explorers to make one step towards safety. Sounds easy enough right? Well try answering a series of multiple choice questions with 10ton Dinosaur chasing you down! If our explorers answer too many incorrect questions then the Dinosaurs will get to enjoy an early Dinner.
